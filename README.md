I developed an interactive dashboard to track key marketing metrics such as campaign performance, lead generation, conversion rates, and ROI. The dashboard includes dynamic charts and tables for analyzing data by channel, campaign, and time period. It allows real-time monitoring of KPIs, enabling the marketing team to quickly identify successful campaigns, optimize underperforming ones, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall marketing strategy and effectiveness. This reduced reporting time by 30% and improved campaign targeting.
